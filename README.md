## Reflections
### Day 1
I relearned a lot of python, and got my hands dirty with some numpy and panda data structures. Definitely excited to learn more!

### Day 2
Notes:

Three types of data (all must be mutually exclusive) :
* Training (80%)
  * Trains the learning algorithm models
* Validation (10%)
  * Verifies which learning algorithm is the best one
  * Determines which one is the final model
* Testing (10%)
  * Tests each of the models

Two types of parameters:

* Learnable
  * The ML algorithm learns these parameters as it goes along
* Hyper-parameters
  * Parameters that we manually insert into the ML algorithm

#### Iris Data

Is a 150 x 4 2D dataset, used commonly in machine learning computing. Note that all the elements are numerical values, the default is long. 

Properties:
* Each row is a sample (test case)
* Each column is an attribute (for example, colorï¼‰
* Feature
  * Given input
* Response
  * Expected output
  
### Day 3

I learned about relatively basic linear ML algorithms, such as linear regression, KMeans, and perceptrons. These algorithms are relatively limited, 
and are unable to solve problems, such as the XOR problem. That being said, however, they are still incredibly useful. For example, KMeans is pretty good for finding patterns in the data. I'm still shocked about the convenience of pre-built functions within ML libraries, making implementation of any algorithm extremely simple.

I also dipped my toes into some TensorFlow algorithms. It seems pretty basic so far, but their logistical functions have much more to offer than the simple linear ones. Below is a solution to the XOR problem.
