## Reflections
### Day 1
I relearned a lot of python, and got my hands dirty with some numpy and panda data structures. Definitely excited to learn more!

### Day 2
Notes:

Three types of data (all must be mutually exclusive) :
* Training (80%)
  * Trains the learning algorithm models
* Validation (10%)
  * Verifies which learning algorithm is the best one
  * Determines which one is the final model
* Testing (10%)
  * Tests each of the models

Two types of parameters:

* Learnable
  * The ML algorithm learns these parameters as it goes along
* Hyper-parameters
  * Parameters that we manually insert into the ML algorithm

#### Iris Data

Is a 150 x 4 2D dataset, used commonly in machine learning computing. Note that all the elements are numerical values, the default is long. 

Properties:
* Each row is a sample (test case)
* Each column is an attribute (for example, colorï¼‰
* Feature
  * Given input
* Response
  * Expected output
